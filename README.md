## Text Processing

This program takes in the excel document as input, does error checking to make sure everything is correct, then outputs the data from the document in a particular fashion.

The program is run in the command line by typing "python Main data\data.csv"

From my experience with this assignment, python is very good at text processing. It was easy to make the program check that everything was formatted and input correctly, and removing spaces and newlines from the file was quite simple as well.

Nearly everything in the assignment was new. I have had to do text processing in other languages, but not in python. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was. The only thing that was a mild review was reading from a file, as I have already had to write a python program to do that in a different class i'm taking this semester.
